Hoto use tbbcp (tor browser bundle copy)
##################################################
The Problem:
if you enter the URL in the URL field in keepassx, then the URL is opened 
with firefox (your default browser)
What do you do with URL's that you ONLY want to access with Tr Browser Bundle?
A double-click on an entry in keepassx might reveal your identity and a 
double click will happen eventually by accident. 

The solution:
keepassx can execute a command instead of opening a URL. The URL is added as 
an option to the command and will be copied to clipboard (primary)

This is what you do:

1. Copy the URL, for wich you want a username and password.
   i.e. https://www.github.com
2. In keepassx add the following to the URL field
   cmd:///usr/bin/tbbcp  https://www.github.com
3. Instead of opening https://www.github.com, th script tbbcp will copy
   the URL to clipboard.
4. Go to the Tor Browser window and insert the URL from clipboard into 
   the URL-field using the middle Mouse button
5. For username and password double-click on them in keepass and insert them 
   with middle mouse button
